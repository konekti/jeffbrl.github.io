For those who follow public cloud, summer is the season of AWS Summits in the U.S. The Amazon Web Services Channel on YouTube posted the playlists for the DC Public Sector Summit and New York Summit. Konekti had several representatives at the Public Sector Summit and I discussed it in a previous [post](https://konekti.us/2018/06/26/konekti-at-the-aws-public-sector-summit.html "Konekti at the AWS Public Sector Summit"). We did not make it to the New York Summit as we did in 2017. Based on the feedback I've received, it sounds like the event was impressive.

You can watch the DC Public Sector playlist at the below link.

The New York playlist includes two great videos related to the AWS VPC.

If you enjoyed our coverage of AWS PrivateLink in a previous [post](https://konekti.us/2018/04/09/the-value-of-aws-privatelink.html "The Value of AWS PrivateLink") by Amir, you'll definitely want to watch the PrivateLink video. Watch the Bring Your Own Public IP Address to the Cloud video as well. I'll be covering this new feature in the next post.
