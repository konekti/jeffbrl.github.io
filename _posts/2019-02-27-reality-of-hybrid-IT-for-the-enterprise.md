title: The Reality of Hybrid IT for the Enterprise

Looking back over the last several years, we've seen we've seen considerable hype surrounding companies going "all-in" on the public cloud.
Large companies such as Capital One and Netflix are industry leaders in this respect and deservingly so. The effort involved is monumental and its
effect on IT consumption within those organizations is transformational. For the majority of the enterprises, I believe that a "cloud-first where
possible" strategy is the right move for the business. For the next five ten to years, I expect that most enterprises will maintain on-premise infrastructure
that requires seamless and secure connectivity to workloads running in one or more public clouds. In this post, I'll be discussing how public cloud providers
have shifted their strategy to accommodate the reality of hybrid IT.

The major public cloud providers have released products aimed at extending their presence into the enterprise data center.

Azure Stacks was the first product in this category followed by AWS Outposts. The former is available now while Outposts is expected to be available in
2H 2019. On a related note, the press is [reporting](https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-and-vmware-reportedly-planning-cloud-partnership) that Microsoft
and VMware might be forging a partnership that may resemble the deal AWS stuck with VMware several years ago. While a dominant player in the data center,
VMware scuttled its public cloud offering and sees its future in cooperating with public cloud providers to easily shift workloads between the data center
and the cloud.

In other developments, IBM--not exactly a leader in the public cloud sector--sees its future in hybrid IT. Matt Asay of TechRepublic makes a compelling
case in his
[Why IBM had no choice but bet $34 billion on hybrid cloud](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-ibm-had-no-choice-but-bet-34-billion-on-hybrid-cloud/)
that IBM's acquisition of RedHat represents a $34B bet on the future of hybrid IT. RedHat's OpenShift offering is in a strong position to accelerate the
movement of workloads between private and public cloud.

At Konekti, we know from talking to enterprises that hybrid IT is not only real but is often very difficult to design and operationalize
the dual infrastructure (or more if multiple public clouds are involved). Finding and retaining the talent with experience in hybrid IT is challenging.
How can you tackle these challenges in a way that doesn't force enterprise IT architects and developers to become experts in the minutia of securely connecting
workloads at potentially hundreds of diverse locations? Steering the design and management of networking and VPC infrastructural components are what we do best.
