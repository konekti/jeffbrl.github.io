We are always impressed at how AWS hosts its Summit conferences. The AWS Public Sector Summit in Washington, DC was 
another great experience for us. We had the opportunity to connect with friends and make new acquaintances. It was nice
to see Andy Jassy join Teresa Carlson in a fireside chat. My favorite talk was my fellow Duke alumnus Alan Halachmi's
[Advanced Architectures with AWS Transit Gateway](https://youtu.be/S9fEydjJ9qo).

Here's a shot of Amir and me in the Expo Hall.

Here's a collection of pictures I took at the event. Click on the thumbnail for the full-size pictures. If you are
wondering, yes, that is A Cloud Guru's Ryan Kroonenburg at the DeepRacer track.
