You are approaching your business’s busy season. The thought of a catastrophic failure in your hybrid cloud infrastructure 
is constantly on your mind. How quickly can you recover from large-scale failure? How can you re-construct your virtual 
deployment to match the pre-disaster state? At Konekti, we’ve observed businesses that are insufficiently prepared for 
disaster recovery. The cloud provides options for restoration that weren’t possible when your applications were running 
on bare metal infrastructure. Let us design templates and automation tools that simplify and streamline reconstruction 
of a virtual deployment.
