Youâ€™ve decided to stop buying physical infrastructure and are ready to fully migrate to the cloud. You are 
fully aware that the business depends on IT infrastructure and that the migration process must be conducted 
in a manner that ensures your business applications are highly available and security cannot be comprised. 
You need assistance in providing a continuity strategy during the migration process as well as advice on a 
method to ensure a highly secure deployment. Consider hiring Konekti to simplify the design and migration process.
