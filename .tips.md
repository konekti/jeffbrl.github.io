# Konekti
## Difference between *gh-pages* and *master*
gh-pages is the branch that github uses to deploy your site by default. It's great, coz then you can be working and pushing to the master without necessary pushing to the live site.

That said, I noticed that you can serve your site from the master but the gh-pages branch has to be there first. 

If you opt to go down that path, click under settings and switch the branch you're using. See the diagram on issue #27 (feedback)

## How do I maintain Konekti?
The following links will help the site owner to come into speed with the quirks of jekyll. I will list the basic parts.

> Go easy on them, they are not exhausting ... they are actually well written (summarised)

* [Jekyll directory Structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/)
* [Front Matter](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll-front-matter/) 
* [Liquid syntax](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll-liquid/)
* [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* [Includes](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll-includes/)

## Plugins
Jekyll has a rich pool of plugins to help with tasks such as: youtube embed videos, embed twitter feed, seo,  ... See [Jekyll plugins](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/)

While jekyll templates are authored in **Ruby**, an initimate grasp of the ruby is not necessary to use it. In fact, most of the constructs used in Jekyll's templating are straight forward.

For example, to loop through a collection or an array is easy, using ruby liquid syntax 
 
```Ruby
 {% for member in page.team %}
     # Loop through Fun weird Science team members  
     # {{ member }}
 {% endfor %}
``` 

or to conditionally include a template

```Ruby
  {% if disqus.name %}
     # show comments widget
  {% endif %}
```

> Notice the **if** and **for** blocks ... they are only unique in that they end with **endif** and **endfor** respectively.

Some aspects of the site are repetitive in nature. In order not to repeat chunks of code that are similar, the info cld be stored in data files. The data could be stored in .json, .csv, .yml files. See the link [data files](https://m.signalvnoise.com/jousting-with-jekyll-20687ceea042)

## Online editors (tooling)
_**[Prose.io](https://prose.io)**_ and _**[siteleaf](www.siteleaf.com)**_ enable you to edit your site from the comfort of your browser like you would do in wordpress. I prefer prose.io to siteleaf, because unlike the latter it's free.

That said, the two options are still at the early stages of development. I personally think they are getting better and more robust. 

## Conclusion

If you figure your way around **front matter, liquid syntax, includes and directory structure**, editing the site will be super easy.
