# Defaults
The config file can hold default values for a range of front matter fields. For example, the yaml config file in these  repo has the default values as follows:
```yaml
defaults:
  -
    scope:
      path: "_posts"
      type: "posts"
    values:
      layout: "post"
      author: "Jeff Loughridge"
      image: "post image"
```
The above configuration sets the *author, image, layout and type*  of all files in the **_posts directory**. 

If you don't wish to use the same values, you can override them in your individual post files.
```yaml
title: AWS CloudFormation Intrinsic Functions
date: 2018-01-25 00:00:00 Z
categories:
- blog
author: Jeff # Use your first name  only
image: intrinsic-functions # change image
# no need to specify the layout unless there is a special layout template for a category
```

Otherwise you don't have to repeat keep typing them.
```yaml
title: AWS CloudFormation Intrinsic Functions
date: 2018-01-25 00:00:00 Z
categories:
  - blog
```

## Writing blog posts
All posts recide inside the **_posts** directory and should be named in the **YEAR-MONTH-DATE-TITLE.md** format like so:

```markdown
  2018-01-04-gyms-are-flooded-in-january.md
```

All images/videos should be uploaded into the **assets** folder. You may create a *sub folder(s)*; feel free

To link the images in the posts, use this syntax

```markdown
![image description](path/filename)
``` 

The image description can be anything that briefly describes the image you're using. It's optional but great for SEO and web accessibiility.

For example, if you have an image file inside the **articles** subfolder inside the **assets** folder, you would use it as follows:

```markdown
![guys telling stories](/assets/articles/january-stories.jpg)
``` 
## Resources

Once you wrap your mind around Jekyll's base concepts
(**[Jekyll directory Structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/)**,
**[Front Matter](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll-front-matter/)**,
**[Liquid syntax](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll-liquid/)**,
**[markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)**,
**[Includes](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll-includes/)**), editing the site will be super easy. 

Leverage the power of tools like *prose.io* and *siteleaf*  when making simple changes to your site.

That said, the two options are still at the early stages of development. I personally think they are getting better and more robust.

## Plugins
Jekyll has a rich pool of plugins to help with tasks such as: youtube embed videos, embed twitter feed, seo,  ... See [Jekyll plugins](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/)

While jekyll templates are authored in **Ruby**, an initimate grasp of the ruby is not necessary to use it. In fact, most of the constructs used in Jekyll's templating are straight forward.

For example, to loop through a collection or an array is easy, using ruby liquid syntax 
 
```Ruby
 {% for member in page.team %}
    # Loop through team members  
    # {{ member }}
 {% endfor %}
``` 

or to conditionally include a template

```Ruby
  {% if disqus.name %}
    # show comments widget
  {% endif %}
```

> Notice the **if** and **for** blocks ... they are only unique in that they end with **endif** and **endfor** respectively.

Some aspects of the site are repetitive in nature. In order not to repeat chunks of code that are similar, the info cld be stored in data files. The data could be stored in .json, .csv, .yml files. See the link [data files](https://m.signalvnoise.com/jousting-with-jekyll-20687ceea042)

## Malchimp Newsleter
You can toggle the mailchimp newsletter widget from the *_config.yml* like so:

```yaml
mailchimp:
  show: true # set to false to hide
```
