## Difference between *gh-pages* and *master*
gh-pages is the branch that github uses to deploy your site by default. It's great, coz then you can be working and pushing to the master without necessary pushing to the live site.

That said, I noticed that you can serve your site from the master but the gh-pages branch has to be there first. 

If you opt to go down that path, click under settings and switch the branch you're using. See the diagram on issue #27 (feedback)

## Writing blog posts
All posts recide inside the **_posts** directory and should be named in the **YEAR-MONTH-DATE-TITLE.md** format like so:

```markdown
  2018-01-04-gyms-are-flooded-in-january.md
```

All images/videos should be uploaded into the **assets** folder. You may create a *sub folder(s)*; feel free

To link the images in the posts, use this syntax

```markdown
![image description](path/filename)
``` 

The image description can be anything that briefly describes the image you're using. It's optional but great for SEO and web accessibiility.

For example, if you have an image file inside the **articles** subfolder inside the **assets** folder, you would use it as follows:

```markdown
![guys telling stories](/assets/articles/january-stories.jpg)
``` 
## Resources

Once you wrap your mind around Jekyll's base concepts
(**[Jekyll directory Structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/)**,
**[Front Matter](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll-front-matter/)**,
**[Liquid syntax](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll-liquid/)**,
**[markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)**,
**[Includes](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll-includes/)**), editing the site will be super easy. 

Leverage the power of tools like *prose.io* and *siteleaf*  when making simple changes to your site.

That said, the two options are still at the early stages of development. I personally think they are getting better and more robust.

## Plugins
Jekyll has a rich pool of plugins to help with tasks such as: youtube embed videos, embed twitter feed, seo,  ... See [Jekyll plugins](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/)

While jekyll templates are authored in **Ruby**, an initimate grasp of the ruby is not necessary to use it. In fact, most of the constructs used in Jekyll's templating are straight forward.

For example, to loop through a collection or an array is easy, using ruby liquid syntax 
 
```Ruby
 {% for member in page.team %}
     # Loop through Fun weird Science team members  
     # {{ member }}
 {% endfor %}
``` 

or to conditionally include a template

```Ruby
  {% if disqus.name %}
     # show comments widget
  {% endif %}
```

> Notice the **if** and **for** blocks ... they are only unique in that they end with **endif** and **endfor** respectively.

Some aspects of the site are repetitive in nature. In order not to repeat chunks of code that are similar, the info cld be stored in data files. The data could be stored in .json, .csv, .yml files. See the link [data files](https://m.signalvnoise.com/jousting-with-jekyll-20687ceea042)
