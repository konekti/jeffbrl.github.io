    Organizations now realize IT must be a hybrid of approaches, using public and private cloud as well as more
    traditional infrastructure because consumers demand flexibility and agility with workloads. Konekti brings decades
    of experience in designing and operating networks at scale with the following services.

    #### Hybrid/Multi-cloud Design & Migration
    Konekti Systems recognizes that for most organizations with investments in on-premises technologies, an evolutionary 
    hybrid cloud architecture is the only path towards cloud adoption. Migrating legacy IT systems takes time. Therefore, 
    selecting the right cloud provider and the best methods to connect to that provider is paramount in achieving business 
    goals.

    Enterprises are very familiar with the applications they use and their data. The problem is that 
    they need to understand how these applications will behave in the new environment. How do the clients access the 
    application’s new home in the public cloud? This problem is compounded when the business keeps the application active in 
    its original location during migration.

    Now, there are two locations to access the information and while the application and the data are the same, the different 
    infrastructure and accessibility make the application delivery complex to manage. Konekti has developed best practices 
    for connecting to public cloud providers as well as networking design guidelines that make it easy for you to integrate 
    the public cloud as a seamless and secure extension of your existing on premise investments.

    #### Advanced Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Connectivity at Scale
    The decisions about VPC inter-connectivity increase in difficulty as the number of VPC grows, particularly when following 
    the best practice of using multiple accounts. When VPCs numbers in the hundreds, well-established design patterns emerge
    to ensure seamless and reliable connectivity while maintaining a strict security posture for your cloud infrastructure.

    #### Modernization of the Enterprise Branch Office using SD-WAN
    The public cloud’s wholesale transformation of IT includes a shifting in enterprise IT requirements for the wide-area 
    network (WAN). The viability of traditional network architectures for interconnecting hundreds or even thousands of remote 
    offices, or branches, is rapidly decreasing as enterprises consume IT as a utility. More agile, secure, and dynamic WAN is 
    needed.

    #### Cloud-native Security Best Practices
    Cloud providers operate under a shared responsibility model. The Cloud Service Provider (CSP) takes responsibility for 
    the security of its infrastructure. Meanwhile, it is customer’s responsibility to ensure that their cloud environment is 
    configured securely, data is not unintentionally exposed, identifying when a user misuses the account, and enforcing 
    compliance and corporate policies. There is a sharp contrast between legacy methods and a more modern,
    cloud-native approach with reliance on a DevOps culture and continuous delivery. In addition, each cloud platform provides its
    own set of native security controls and tools which might differ from provider to provider and from the third partly tools 
    currently deployed on-premises. At Konekti, we will use your move to the cloud as an opportunity to catalog all your existing
    security tools using a requirements-driven approach. We will adopt CSP native controls when requirements permit and make sure 
    any third party solutions you are considering meet your overall security requirements, ensuring that they can integrate with 
    the cloud native tools through the use of cloud-native APIs.

    #### Next-generation Firewall Cloud Deployments
    At Konekti, we use your move to the cloud as an opportunity to analyze any third-party security solutions you are considering
    for deployment in the cloud, based on you your overall security requirements. Third party Next Generation Firewalls provide a 
    crucial role for the enforcement of your network security polices in your organization, creating the necessary security 
    perimeter and internal security boundaries around your critical data assets in the cloud. Choosing the right firewall, and the 
    necessary network security trust model is becoming increasingly difficult. Konekti can assist you in the definition of your 
    network security trust model and trust boundaries. Furthermore, Konekti engineers will assist you in choosing the right 
    Next Generation firewall technology and the appropriate design and configurations to support your organization’s current and 
    future needs.

    #### Container Security using Service Mesh Architectures
    Containers have simplified how organizations deploy and manage applications by abstracting the underlying infrastructure and 
    focusing on the applications and its dependencies. This allows enterprises to run their applications on any kind of deployment 
    platform whether self-managed on-premise, self-managed in the public cloud, or as a service in the public cloud.  In a 
    containerized world, Kubernetes is the clear winner of the orchestration arms race, abstracting the complexity of managing large
    fleets of compute nodes. As Kubernetes enables ever larger deployments, the need for a companion technology aimed at a simpler 
    way of managing and securing large portfolios of services has become evident. The new Service Mesh architecture is aimed at 
    decoupling many of the security related functions within a microservices architecture. At Konekti, Our security consultants 
    will work closely with you to analyze your environment, determine possible threats, and find the right solution to protect your 
    micro services based applications using the best Service Mesh framework for your needs.
