- name: Hybrid and Multi-cloud Design and Migration
  details: "Konekti Systems recognizes that for most organizations with investments in on-premises technologies, an evolutionary hybrid cloud architecture is the only path towards cloud adoption. Migrating legacy IT systems takes time. Therefore, selecting the right cloud provider and the best methods to connect to that provider is paramount in achieving business goals. \r\n\r\n Enterprises are very familiar with the applications they use and their data. The problem is that they need to understand how these applications will behave in the new environment. How do the clients access the application’s new home in the Public cloud? This problem is compounded when the business keeps the application active in its original location during migration. \r\n\r\n Now, there are two locations to access the information and while the application and the data are the same, the different infrastructure and accessibility make the application delivery complex to manage. Konekti has developed best practices for connecting to Public Cloud providers as well as networking design guidelines that make it easy for you to integrate the public cloud as a seamless and secure extension of your existing on premise investments."
               
- name: Modernization of the Enterprise Branch Office using SD-WAN
  details: >-
    The public cloud’s wholesale transformation of IT includes a shifting in enterprise IT requirements for the wide-area 
    network (WAN). The viability of traditional network architectures for interconnecting hundreds or even thousands of remote 
    offices, or branches, is rapidly decreasing as enterprises consume IT as a utility. More agile, secure, and dynamic WAN is 
    needed.
