    Organizations realize IT must be a hybrid of approaches, using public and private cloud as well as more
    traditional infrastructure. The network is a fundamental component in any hybrid IT architecture. Konekti 
    brings decades of experience in designing and operating networks at scale. Not only do we grasp what it takes 
    to design a physical network, we possess the cloud-savviness required serve as your partner in your public cloud 
    adoption.

    #### Hybrid IT Network Design & Migration
    Konekti Systems recognizes that for most organizations with investments in on-premises technologies, an evolutionary 
    hybrid cloud architecture is the only path towards cloud adoption. Migrating legacy IT systems takes time. 

    An early question for many organizations is, "Is my current data center network optimized for connecting to the cloud?"
    For organizations that have traditional data centers, the complex and heterogeneous nature of the network inhibits
    streamlined connectivity to the cloud. If your organization currently takes days or weeks to add a virtual LAN (VLAN) 
    or change a firewall rule, this is a sign your network is not ready to be easily extended to the cloud. Our cloud readiness
    assessments can help you determine what steps are required to ensure simple and resilent connectivity to the cloud.

    For organizations that have many remote branches, determining how to connect these sites to the public cloud is
    challenging as many options exist. Should you buy private lines directly to the public cloud at each site or backhaul
    traffic to headquarters using existing MPLS circuits? When is using a VPN over the Internet the best option? Konekti has 
    developed best practices for connecting to the public cloud as well as networking design guidelines that make it easy 
    for you to integrate the public cloud as a seamless and secure extension of your existing on premise investments.

    #### Advanced Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Connectivity at Scale
    The decisions about VPC inter-connectivity increase in difficulty as the number of VPC grows, particularly when following 
    the best practice of using multiple accounts. When VPCs numbers in the hundreds, well-established design patterns emerge
    to ensure seamless and reliable connectivity while maintaining a strict security posture for your cloud infrastructure.
    VPC components such as Transit Gateway and PrivateLink provide powerful abstractions for networking the public cloud.
    Should you invest your developers' time in mastering networking within the public cloud or should they be writing 
    innovative applications? We can offload the complexity of designing inter-VPC networking 
    and avoid the pain points by following proven network designs.

    Research shows many cloud migrations fail due to a limited understanding of the cloud-based security offerings. Konekti 
    seamlessly combines enterprise security best practices with deep expertise in emerging security trends for hybrid 
    environments.

    #### Cloud-native Security Best Practices
    Cloud providers operate under a shared responsibility model. The Cloud Service Provider (CSP) takes responsibility for 
    the security of its infrastructure. Meanwhile, it is customer’s responsibility to ensure that their cloud environment is 
    configured securely, data is not unintentionally exposed, identifying when a user misuses the account, and enforcing 
    compliance and corporate policies. There is a sharp contrast between legacy methods and a more modern,
    cloud-native approach with reliance on a DevOps culture and continuous delivery. In addition, each cloud platform provides its
    own set of native security controls and tools which might differ from provider to provider and from the third partly tools 
    currently deployed on-premises. At Konekti, we will use your move to the cloud as an opportunity to catalog all your existing
    security tools using a requirements-driven approach. We will adopt CSP native controls when requirements permit and make sure 
    any third party solutions you are considering meet your overall security requirements, ensuring that they can integrate with 
    the cloud native tools through the use of cloud-native APIs.

    #### Next-generation Firewall Cloud Deployments
    At Konekti, we use your move to the cloud as an opportunity to analyze any third-party security solutions you are considering
    for deployment in the cloud, based on you your overall security requirements. Third party Next Generation Firewalls provide a 
    crucial role for the enforcement of your network security polices in your organization, creating the necessary security 
    perimeter and internal security boundaries around your critical data assets in the cloud. Choosing the right firewall, and the 
    necessary network security trust model is becoming increasingly difficult. Konekti can assist you in the definition of your 
    network security trust model and trust boundaries. Furthermore, Konekti engineers will assist you in choosing the right 
    Next Generation firewall technology and the appropriate design and configurations to support your organization’s current and 
    future needs.

    No cloud migration strategy is complete without the inclusion of automation and DevOps best practices into both engineering 
    and operational procedures. Konekti guides organizations through selection, development and deployment of these tools and
    best practices. At Konekti, we use Terraform and CloudFormation to build VPC infrastructure. Additionally, we have extensive
    experience automating network infrastructure on-premises. This combination positions us to meet the automation needs of
    enterprises operating in a hybrid IT environment.
