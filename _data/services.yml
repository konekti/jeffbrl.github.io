    Organizations now realize IT must be a hybrid of approaches, using public and private cloud as well as more
    traditional infrastructure because consumers demand flexibility and agility with workloads. Konekti brings decades
    of experience in designing and operating networks at scale with the following services.

    ###### Hybrid/Multi-cloud Design & Migration
    Konekti Systems recognizes that for most organizations with investments in on-premises technologies, an evolutionary 
    hybrid cloud architecture is the only path towards cloud adoption. Migrating legacy IT systems takes time. Therefore, 
    selecting the right cloud provider and the best methods to connect to that provider is paramount in achieving business 
    goals.

    Enterprises are very familiar with the applications they use and their data. The problem is that 
    they need to understand how these applications will behave in the new environment. How do the clients access the 
    application’s new home in the Public cloud? This problem is compounded when the business keeps the application active in 
    its original location during migration.

    Now, there are two locations to access the information and while the application and the data are the same, the different 
    infrastructure and accessibility make the application delivery complex to manage. Konekti has developed best practices 
    for connecting to Public Cloud providers as well as networking design guidelines that make it easy for you to integrate 
    the public cloud as a seamless and secure extension of your existing on premise investments.

    ###### Advanced Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Connectivity at Scale
    The decisions about VPC inter-connectivity increase in difficulty as the number of VPC grows, particularly when following 
    the best practice of using multiple accounts. When VPCs numbers in the hundreds, well-established design patterns emerge
    to ensure seamless and reliable connectivity while maintaining a strict security posture for your cloud infrastructure.

    ###### Modernization of the Enterprise Branch Office using SD-WAN
    The public cloud’s wholesale transformation of IT includes a shifting in enterprise IT requirements for the wide-area 
    network (WAN). The viability of traditional network architectures for interconnecting hundreds or even thousands of remote 
    offices, or branches, is rapidly decreasing as enterprises consume IT as a utility. More agile, secure, and dynamic WAN is 
    needed.
